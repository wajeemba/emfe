# EM Frequency Explorer

**From lightning to gamma rays.**
More than twenty orders of magnitude on a single logarithmic ruler. Everything we
broadcast, navigate by, cook with, and see falls somewhere along this line.

EM Frequency Explorer (`emfe`) is an interactive, zoomable explorer for the
electromagnetic spectrum — the "make the static NTIA/FCC frequency allocation
poster actually fun to explore" idea, taken end to end from below ELF (lightning,
the magnetosphere) through radio, visible light, UV, X-ray, and gamma.

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the full specification.

## The idea

A single continuous **log-frequency axis** with **semantic zoom**:

- Zoomed all the way out — the seven great regions: Radio · Microwave ·
  Infrared · Visible · Ultraviolet · X-ray · Gamma.
- Zoom into Radio — it subdivides into the ITU bands: VLF · LF · MF · HF ·
  VHF · UHF · SHF · EHF.
- Zoom further — real allocations appear: AM/FM/TV broadcast, WiFi 2.4/5/6E,
  cellular 3G/4G/5G, GPS, ADS-B, marine VHF, the amateur (ham) bands, ISM
  433/915 MHz, and more.

Region labels are always visible; detail emerges as you descend.

## Layers

Toggleable filters let you focus on what you care about:

- **Consumer / everyday** — AM/FM/TV, WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular
- **Ham + ISM / SDR** — amateur bands (with a deep sub-band plan by license
  class), 433/915 MHz, key fobs, garage doors
- **Navigation / aviation** — GPS/GNSS, ADS-B, aviation voice, marine VHF,
  weather satellites
- **Gov / public safety / satellite** — first responders, satellite
  up/downlink, radar
- **Physical science** — visible light in true color, UV (blacklight), IR
  (heat lamps), medical/dental X-ray, and fun annotations (e.g. an MRI's RF
  excitation pulse sits near 64 MHz)

## Data

Allocation data is sourced from authoritative references (FCC Table of
Frequency Allocations, ARRL / Part 97 amateur band plan) and kept current via
a scheduled sync, so the atlas stays in step with reality and every change
shows up as a reviewable diff.

## Scope

**USA-scoped for now.** Allocations follow US regulators — the FCC Table of
Frequency Allocations and FCC Part 97 / ARRL amateur band plan. The physics
(regions, ITU band nomenclature, wavelengths) is universal, but the specific
allocations are US ones; other ITU regions may come later.

## Brand & style guide

Visual identity carried over from the prototype (`moodboards/`):

| Role                                            | Typeface                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Headings                                        | **Newsreader** (serif)          |
| Body / UI                                       | **Hanken Grotesk** (sans-serif) |
| Technical readouts (frequencies, ticks, labels) | **JetBrains Mono**              |

Fonts are self-hosted via [`@fontsource-variable`](https://fontsource.org) (no
external Google Fonts request), imported in [`src/routes/+layout.svelte`](src/routes/+layout.svelte).
JetBrains Mono replaces IBM Plex Mono, which has no variable build.

- **Icons** — [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (`lucide-svelte`) is the project's
  icon set.
- **Color** — every color is a CSS custom property in
  [`src/app.css`](src/app.css); never a hard-coded hex in markup. Light + dark
  themes, with region and content-layer palettes defined there.
- **Spectrum band** — the continuous gradient fades to transparent at **both**
  ends (below ELF and above gamma): asymptotically there is always a lower and a
  higher frequency.

## Status

Early development. Building toward a live deployment.
