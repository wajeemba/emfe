# EM Frequency Explorer

**From lightning to gamma rays.** More than twenty orders of magnitude on a
single logarithmic ruler. Everything we broadcast, navigate by, cook with, and
see falls somewhere along this line.

EM Frequency Explorer (`emfe`) is an interactive, zoomable explorer for the
electromagnetic spectrum — the "make the static NTIA/FCC frequency-allocation
poster actually _fun_ to explore" idea, taken end to end from below ELF
(lightning, the magnetosphere) through radio, microwave, infrared, visible
light, UV, X-ray, and gamma.

It's built as an **educational tool** for the technically curious — hobbyists,
makers, ham-radio operators, students, and educators — not as instrument-grade
reference for RF engineers. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the full specification.

## The idea

A single continuous **log-frequency axis** (~24 decades) with **semantic zoom**:

- Zoomed all the way out — the seven great regions: Radio · Microwave ·
  Infrared · Visible · Ultraviolet · X-ray · Gamma.
- Zoom into Radio — it subdivides into the ITU bands: VLF · LF · MF · HF ·
  VHF · UHF · SHF · EHF.
- Zoom further — real allocations appear: AM/FM/TV broadcast, Wi-Fi 2.4/5/6E,
  cellular 3G/4G/5G, GPS, ADS-B, marine VHF, the amateur (ham) bands, ISM
  433/915 MHz, and more — down to individual channels.

Region labels are always visible; detail emerges as you descend.

## The three tiers

The spectrum is governed at three altitudes, and the chart shows all three as
stacked lanes — the same framing the federal rules use (47 CFR Part 2, Subpart B:
_"Allocation, Assignment, and Use of Radio Frequencies"_):

- **Application** _(top)_ — the recognizable thing that actually uses a band:
  FM radio, Wi-Fi, GPS, ADS-B. Markers ride on the spectrum gradient.
- **Assignment** _(middle)_ — specific frequencies _designated_ for one job:
  Marine Channel 16, the 121.5/243 MHz emergency guards, CB Channel 9.
- **Allocation** _(bottom)_ — a continuous, **gap-free** ribbon of the radio
  _services_ each band is allocated to (FIXED, MOBILE, BROADCASTING, …), straight
  from the US Table of Frequency Allocations. This is what makes the chart honest:
  there is no "empty" radio spectrum, only spectrum whose allocation a layperson
  wouldn't recognize. Filter it by service category and by **Federal vs Civilian**.

Each tier has its own control section in the dock, and each can be toggled
independently.

## Layers

Toggleable filters let you focus on what you care about:

- **Consumer / everyday** — AM/FM/TV, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular
- **Ham + ISM / SDR** — amateur bands (with a deep sub-band plan by license
  class), 433/915 MHz, key fobs, garage doors
- **Navigation / aviation** — GPS/GNSS, ADS-B, aviation voice, marine VHF,
  weather satellites
- **Gov / public safety / satellite** — first responders, satellite
  up/downlink, radar
- **Physical science** — visible light in true color, UV (blacklight), IR
  (heat lamps), medical/dental X-ray, and fun annotations (e.g. an MRI's RF
  excitation pulse sits near 64 MHz)

## Data

Allocation data is compiled from authoritative public references — the FCC/NTIA
Table of Frequency Allocations ([47 CFR §2.106](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-2/subpart-B/section-2.106))
and the FCC Part 97 / ARRL amateur band plan — and lives as reviewable JSON under
[`data/`](data/). Application/assignment markers are in
[`data/allocations/`](data/allocations/); the gap-free allocation substrate
(8.3 kHz–275 GHz, curated from and verified against the §2.106 table) is in
[`data/allocation-table/`](data/allocation-table/). Every change shows up as a
plain diff, so the atlas can stay in step with reality over time.

**USA-scoped for now.** Allocations follow US regulators. The physics (regions,
ITU band nomenclature, wavelengths) is universal, but the specific allocations
are US ones; other ITU regions may come later.

## Contributing

This is an educational tool that gets better with more eyes on it, and the data
will always need tweaking and updating. Contributions are very welcome —
especially:

- **Data accuracy** — corrections and updates to allocations, with a citation
  to an authoritative source where possible.
- **New allocations or annotations** that make a band more illuminating.
- **Bug fixes and UI/accessibility improvements.**

## Develop

Requires Node 20+ and npm.

```bash
npm install      # first time only
npm run dev      # dev server with HMR → http://localhost:5173
```

Build & preview the production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # → http://localhost:4173
```

Checks (the pre-commit gate / CI):

```bash
npm run check          # svelte-check (types)
npm run lint           # prettier --check + eslint
npm test               # vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright end-to-end (auto build + preview)
npm run data:validate  # validate the allocation dataset against the schema
```

## Brand & style

Visual identity carried over from the prototype (`moodboards/`):

| Role                                            | Typeface                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Headings                                        | **Newsreader** (serif)          |
| Body / UI                                       | **Hanken Grotesk** (sans-serif) |
| Technical readouts (frequencies, ticks, labels) | **JetBrains Mono**              |

Fonts are self-hosted via [`@fontsource-variable`](https://fontsource.org) (no
external Google Fonts request), imported in
[`src/routes/+layout.svelte`](src/routes/+layout.svelte).

- **Icons** — [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (`lucide-svelte`).
- **Color** — every color is a CSS custom property in
  [`src/app.css`](src/app.css); never a hard-coded hex in markup. Light + dark
  themes, with region and content-layer palettes defined there.
- **Spectrum band** — the continuous gradient fades to transparent at **both**
  ends (below ELF and above gamma): asymptotically there is always a lower and a
  higher frequency.
